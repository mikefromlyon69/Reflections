When would you want to create a remote repo rather than keeping all you work local?

  - To collaborate with people all around the world
  - To allow people to review my code
  - To allow me to work on a project with different computers
  
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 - Because I don't want broken code to be pulled automatically
 
 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 - Forks are a GitHub Feature only. I would use it when I want to make changes to a repo when I'm not a collaborator
 - Using branches is great testing newfeatures without breaking the initial version
 - Cloning would allow me to have a local version of a remote repo
 
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    To have a copy that I can work on without an Internet access.
    
 How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
 
  It would be possible but more difficult.
  For example, I could use a shared folder online (DropBox...) but I wouldn't easily see the changes. Plus, there are no pull requests in a simple shared folders : anyone in the group could change something without noticing other making it more diffcult to track changes and bugs.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master? What benefits does each approach have?

I would work with branches if I wanted to experiment things without breaking master. For example, if I wanted to support other languages.

On the other hand, I'd rather make changes in master if I wanted to change a core functionnality that I'm sur about.
