When would you want to create a remote repo rather than keeping all you work local?

  - To collaborate with people all around the world
  - To allow people to review my code
  - To allow me to work on a project with different computers
  
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 - Because I don't want broken code to be pulled automatically
 
 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

 - Forks are a GitHub Feature only. I would use it when I want to make changes to a repo when I'm not a collaborator
 - Using branches is great testing newfeatures without breaking the initial version
 - Cloning would allow me to have a local version of a remote repo
