When would you want to create a remote repo rather than keeping all you work local?

  - To collaborate with people all around the world
  - To allow people to review my code
  - To allow me to work on a project with different computers
  
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

 - Because I don't want broken code to be pulled automatically
